For this homwork we want you to host a react app online (20 points)

Ideally you should host your resume site online and share the link with us in this README file

your submission should be a github repo with the URL in the readme.

We highly recommend using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for hosting this app since it's essentially 0 config for vite apps.
